## Hello World

- This profile is meant to give you a little insight into my workflow as a bioinformatician (portfolio)
- Currently I am seeking a bioinformatical position after graduating with a masters degree in Bioinformatics form MLU Halle (Germany)

*Iâ€™m currently working on*
- Creating a creater HUB that reflects all my knowledge and projects from uni and private interest (structured, such that i find stuff easily)
- I am writing a creater HUB for my bioinforamtics/biostatistics/ML/AI work to enhance reproduceability and reaching a professional level
- Since uni mainly focuses on theoretical background and applying analysis onto polished dataset, I am doing different analysis or enginnering tasks on (biological) public data (e.g. rna-seq of arabidposis thaliana, image data from pneumonia, ...)
