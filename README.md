# *Welcome to my Github* :collision:

Hey people, 
I enjoy coding and have a background in Bioinformatics. I am currently making my steps towards a bioinformatics machine learning professional, writing reprodcuable projects with Makefiles and Snakemake.  

**About me**
- I work with Python, R, Bash and Latex in Bioinformatics Projects using Snakemake, Git, Anaconda and Docker
- I use Java for its entensive Core Library, JVM and reasonable speed
- I taugth myself C with some smaller projects and books, I was motivated by the simple integration into Python, its speed and the deeper understading of memory in computers   
- I am currently working on a portfolio to showcase my work skills, doing that I work with vscode and jupyter notebooks and I relaize that some handy functionality for bioinformatics analysis is missing

**Ideas**
- Write a matplotlib wrapper that reduces boilerplate code in the notebooks and bound specifc plot function to the axes API (R like plots)
- Select patterns from matplotlib plots and translate that into the corresponding table selection (e.g. healty and unhealty cluster, maybe some outlier)

**Languages**
