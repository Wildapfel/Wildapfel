# *Welcome to my Github*

- B.Sc. Molecular Biology & Biotechnology (TU Dresden)
- M.Sc. Bioinformatics (MLU Halle)
- Located in Dresden (Saxony, Germany)
- Currently I am seeking a Bioinformatics remote position
- I am showing my bioinformatics workflows, meant to be my portfolio for applications
- The workflows are private, I only make you a contributor if I apply at your company

### *Theses*
- Discovering & Localizing Motifs in DAP-seq data with CNNs and XAI (Integrated Gradients)
- Quantification of Embryo Nuclei of Flatworm using CNNs and tracked 4D image data  (Bachelor)

### *Skills*
- Sequence Modelling
- Motif Discovery & Localisation (statisitcal & ML/AI)
- DGE Analysis
- Bio-Image Analysis

### Languages & Frameworks
- Python, R, Java, C, Bash 
- TensorFlow/keras,
- Scikit-learn, Scikit-Image, scipy
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, BioPython
- Bash, Git, Conda
- Snakemake

### *Iâ€™m currently working on*
- Creating a HUB that reflects all my knowledge and projects from uni and private interest (structured, such that i find stuff easily)
- I am writing a codebase for my bioinforamtics/biostatistics/ML/AI work to enhance reproduceability and reaching a professional level
- Since uni mainly focuses on theoretical background and applying analysis onto polished dataset, I am doing different analysis or enginnering tasks on (biological) public data (e.g. rna-seq of arabidposis thaliana, image data from pneumonia, ...)
